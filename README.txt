The jupyter notebook entitled Main_Notebook.ipynb is the jouster notebook that presents our code and calls functions.

Any function that isnâ€™t written in the jupiter notebook is written in functions.py

We wrote some tests for our functions in fcn_tester.py, but one of them loads a CMB .fits file so if you want to run these yourselves make sure that you have the file ../CMB_maps/LFI_SkyMap_030_1024_R2.01_full.fits from the planck data release that we cite in our paper.

The paper is called PHYS_321_Final_Report.pdf

Author Contribution:
Ana Hoban and Harper Sewalls worked together on every aspect of this project including planning the approach, coding the functions, and writing the report.
