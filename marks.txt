General comments
----------------------------------------

This was a very well-executed project! I
appreciate the care that you took to get
the details right. The writeup was done
well and was easy to understand.

Also, nice touch with importing the Tegmark
et al. junk map technique for defining
the different regions.

On a quick glance, I actually came to the
opposite conclusion as you did for RSM vs
SHMII! If it weren't for the denominators
in Equation (10), it would actually be the
same as Equation (4) because of Parseval's
theorem. (Think of each map as a vector;
the spherical harmonic transform is a
unitary transformation, so the sum/integral
of the dot product of two vectors is the same).
This means that SHMII is actually the
same as RSM except it downweights high l
(because of the 1/(2l + 1) factor). I think
to really figure out what's going on, we'd
have to think about the noise and the beams.

It has been truly a pleasure having the
two of you in both of my classes. Hope you
have an enjoyable and restful summer!

Best,
Adrian
